/**
  TestHelper

  Responsible for intercepting System.out and returning the intercepted
  text as a String object.

  There are two states: "Intercepting and "Not Intercepting".

  "Intercepting": Everything send to System.out is being intercepted
  and will soon be converted into a String.

  "Not Intercepting": Everything sent to System.out functions as you
  would otherwise expect.

  If you attempt to start intercepting when you are already
  intercepting, then you will get an Exception. Don't do that!

  If you attempt to stop intercepting when you are not already
  intercepting, then you will get an Exception. Don't do that either!

  Use startIntercepting() to start intercepting.

  Use stopIntercepting() to stop intercepting and get a String.

  !!! THE METHODS IN THIS CLASS ARE NOT THREAD SAFE !!!
